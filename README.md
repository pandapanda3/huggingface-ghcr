# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face packaging using GitHub Container Registry

Learn how to create a container and package it with GitHub Actions. This repository gives you a good starting point for a Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflow, and Python code.

The web application uses FastAPI with Hugging Face and exposes a single endpoint that you can interact with it. 

Fork this repository and run the GitHub Actions as-is so that you can register your own containerized application with no modifications needed.
# Run the service locally
First, run the service locally to confirm there are no issues. Then, run it again locally in Docker to ensure the service functions correctly within the container. Finally, deploy the workflow in GitHub Actions.First, run the service locally to confirm there are no issues.

## Generate the environment
`conda create --name huggingface python=3.8`

`conda activate huggingface`

`pip install --upgrade pip`

## Run locally
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
if it has the problem of "Could not build wheels for tokenizers, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects", install rust compiler in your environment, you can use the command:
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
`

Allow warnings: `export RUSTFLAGS='-A warnings'`

Allow invalid reference casting: `export RUSTFLAGS='-A invalid_reference_casting'`

and then restart the Pycharm.
## Check uvicorn
`which uvicorn`
## Run the service
`cd webapp/`

`uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 main:app
`
## Open the link of the service
`http://0.0.0.0:8000`

FastAPI: `http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs`

# Build the container
## Click to start the local Docker application.
## Build a Docker image
`cd ..`

`docker build -t huggingface:local .`
## Run a container from an image
`docker run -i -p 8000:8000 huggingface:local
`

# Run workflow in github
* Navigate to the Actions Tab: In your GitHub repository, click on the "Actions" tab at the top of the page. This will take you to the GitHub Actions dashboard where all workflows are listed.

* Select the Workflow: In the list of workflows on the left sidebar, click on the name of the workflow you want to run manually (e.g., "CI" or "Build and Deploy").

* Run the Workflow: Near the top right of the workflow page, click on the "Run workflow" button. A dropdown will appear, allowing you to select the branch (typically "main" or "master") to run the workflow on.

* Confirm the Run: After selecting the branch, click the "Run workflow" button in the dropdown to start the workflow. GitHub will then queue the workflow and start running it.
